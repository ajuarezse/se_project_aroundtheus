# 🌍 Around The U.S. Project

## 📖 Project Overview

The Around the U.S., Project is a social web platform where users can document and share their journeys around the world. Users have the ability to customize their profiles, upload and manage photos, describe their favorite travel spots, and engage with others by liking or unliking content. This application is built with modern web technologies, prioritizing an interactive and responsive user experience, supported by a well-structured and maintainable codebase that follows object-oriented programming principles.

## 🔑 Key Features include:

📸 **Photo Sharing:** Users can effortlessly upload and showcase their travel photos, add location descriptions, and interact with other users through likes and comments.
📱 **Mobile-Friendly Design:** The app is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
✅ **Profile Customization:** Users can update their personal information, such as name and bio, to create a more tailored and engaging user profile.
💻 **Object-Oriented Programming:** The app’s codebase is structured using OOP techniques, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, ensuring it’s both scalable and easy to maintain.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:

**JavaScript (ES6+):** Employed for scripting dynamic content and interactive elements.
**HTML & CSS:** Used for the structure and styling of the application.
**Responsive Design with Flexbox:** Ensured that the app looks great and functions well on all device sizes.
**OOP Principles:** Implemented object-oriented programming practices to enhance code organization and reusability.
**Flat BEM File Structure:** Applied BEM methodology to maintain clear and manageable CSS organization.

## 🚀 OOP Concepts Applied

🔒 **Encapsulation:** Internal states of objects are protected, exposing only necessary methods to the user interface.
🧬 **Inheritance:** Leveraged a class-based hierarchy, allowing shared properties and methods to be inherited by multiple classes, facilitating code reuse.
🎭 **Polymorphism:** Enabled flexible functionality by treating objects as instances of their parent class, allowing for dynamic method implementation.

## 🛠️ Development Process

**Figma:** Utilized for creating and refining design prototypes, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly interface.

This project is part of an assignment to create and style the front-end components for the app using Javascript. I plan to expand this project with additional features and functionalities. The work I’ve done so far demonstrates my skills in Javascript, API integration, and front-end development.
